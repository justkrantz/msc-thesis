## Introduction
Before calibration on water balance in the study area, the the starting conductance is calculated by the water balance for the infiltration ponds themselves: By taking heads and budget changes (flows) from OM and dividing the two, giving cell conductances.  This conductance dataset will be used as input for the calibration. The following diagram shows the calibration procedure:

cond1 : Calculated by taking heads and budget changes (flows) from OM. dividing the two gives cell conductances.

## Calibrated
To calibrate on the water balance, the conductances of the infiltration ponds in the study area need to be scaled by a factor of 0.625. Now the effect on the fresh-saline interface can be investigated
